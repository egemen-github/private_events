# private_events
This project assignment is from The Odin Project's [Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) curriculum.

## What is this?
This project is similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can host events at a specific time and place and attend created events. 

## Practiced:
* ActiveRecord's associations, many-to-many relationships.
* Foreign keys and custom class names.
* Devise to handle authentication.
