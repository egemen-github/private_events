# private_events
This project assignment is from The Odin Project's [Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) curriculum.

## What is this?
This project is similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can host events at a specific time and place and attend created events. 

## Practiced Mainly:
* ActiveRecord's associations, many-to-many relationships.
* Foreign keys and custom class names.
* Devise to handle authentication.

## Getting Started:
Clone the repo to your local machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/egemen-github/private_events.git
```
Next, install the needed gems:
```
$ bundle install
```
Then, Migrate:
```
$ rails db:migrate
```
Run the server:
```
$ rails server
```
Finally, you can open it on your browser using:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```
## How it looks and works:
